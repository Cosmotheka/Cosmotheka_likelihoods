# Cosmotheka Likelihoods

The aim of this repository is to act as a container for likelihoods used with data generated with [`xC-ell/xCell`](https://github.com/xC-ell/xCell). This includes code used in published papers as well as experiments, so take care before using these codes if you don't know what you're doing!

The current contents of this repo are:
- [papers](papers) contains likelihoods used in published papers.
  - [papers/growth_history](papers/growth_history) contains the likelihood used in [Garcia-Garcia et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12108).
- [ClLike](ClLike) contains a Cobaya-based general power-spectrum-based likelihood for projected large-scale structure data.
