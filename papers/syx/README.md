# Cosmic shear, tSZ, and X-rays

This repository accompanies the paper "X+y: insights on gas thermodynamics from the combination of X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data cross-correlated with cosmic shear" (LINK TBD).

The resources hosted here are:

## Data
Some of the power spectrum measurements used in the paper can be found [here](https://entangled.physics.ox.ac.uk/index.php/s/23LZrRc9hBQKYp9). There, you will find two files containing power spectra from the DES Y3 cosmic shear data, the Planck 2015 Compton-y map, and the ROSAT X-ray map. The two files represent two different ways of addressing the contamination from non-thermal X-ray point sources. See the README file there for more details.

## Example notebook
The [example notebook](DataView.ipynb) shows the steps needed to read these files and interpret the data contained within them, using the [SACC](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/sacc) library.

## Credit and feedback
If you use these data, we kindly ask you to cite [La Posta et al. 2025](LINK TBD). If you have questions or find any issues with the data, feel free to open an issue here or contact the authors.
